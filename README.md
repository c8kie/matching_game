# Memory Game

## Installation

Installation is not required.

## Rules

The goal of the game is to find pairs of cards with the same picture. Once you found all corresponding pairs the game will end, and you will be shown your progress (your time, number of moves and star rating).

## Ratings

The game keeps track of number of moves made by player (valid ones), and it will give you a star rating based on how many moves does it take to win the game (the less the better). The game also features a timer, that is resetted with every new game, but it doesn't affect your rating in no way; for now, it is here just for the sake of fact.

## Requirements

The game is playable on any device that has at least 320px wide screen and supports javascript.
